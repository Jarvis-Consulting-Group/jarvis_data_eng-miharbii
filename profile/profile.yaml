# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I have a degree in Computer Engineering from Polytechnique Montreal, with a focus on management tools. During my studies, I worked on various projects in web development and embedded systems. I had the opportunity to complete two internships, one as a developer and Scrum Master at Ericsson, and the other as a full-stack developer at Orsima. I discovered my passion for programming during my studies and was amazed by how code could bring ideas to life and solve real problems.What excites me about the software industry is its constant evolution to meet changing user and business needs. I'm drawn to the industry because of the opportunity to create innovative solutions that can improve people's lives and solve complex problems. I'm a strong advocate for online learning and continuously take courses and tutorials to improve my technical skills and stay up-to-date with current trends.

    description: The project involved creating a Visual Studio Code extension using TypeScript, Java, HTML, and CSS to improve the visualization of source code performance with Trace Compass. As the team manager, I was responsible for overseeing a team of five members, managing project constraints and risks, handling changes in requirements, and addressing the departure of a team member. In addition, I liaised with the client to ensure that their expectations were met, and I also studied the existing code in the Trace Compass server to integrate the necessary code and create the required Visual Studio extension.
  - name: "Swarm of exploration drones"
    git_url:
    description: I worked on a project to design a swarm of explorer drones to map a building. As part of a six-person team, I used my TypeScript, HTML, SCSS, Angular, C, and C++ skills to create efficient drones and develop an exploration algorithm. I also created a web application that communicated with the drones using commands and displayed a map of the explored room in real time. This project allowed me to develop my problem solving and complex software design skills.
  - name: "Web drawing application"

    description: I used my expertise in TypeScript, HTML, SCSS, Angular, and design patterns to develop Poly Dessin, a web application for drawing shapes. Working with my team, we created a database and tested all functionalities. 
  - name: "Design and Realization of an Autonomous Robot"
    git_url:
    description: I designed and assembled a robot using my knowledge of C++, Linux, and object-oriented programming. I studied the components of the robot, including the motherboard, expansion board, and Atmega324, and programmed the processor and H-bridge to keep the robot running. I then presented the project, the methods used and the different steps to a panel of judges.
